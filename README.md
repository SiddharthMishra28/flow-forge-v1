## üèó Architecture

### Core Entities

1.  **Application**: Represents a GitLab project with access credentials.
2.  **TestData**: Key-value pairs of test data associated with an Application, with category and description.
3.  **FlowStep**: An individual test automation step with a branch, test tag, and initial data.
4.  **Flow**: An orchestrated sequence of flow steps.
5.  **FlowExecution**: An instance of a flow execution with runtime state.
6.  **PipelineExecution**: A GitLab pipeline execution within a flow.

## üìñ API Reference

### 1. Applications

-   `POST /api/applications`: Create a new application.
-   `GET /api/applications/{id}`: Get an application by ID.
-   `GET /api/applications`: Get all applications.
-   `PUT /api/applications/{id}`: Update an application.
-   `DELETE /api/applications/{id}`: Delete an application.

### 2. Test Data

**Create Test Data**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/test-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "applicationId": 1,
    "category": "API_CREDENTIALS",
    "description": "Credentials for the staging environment API",
    "testData": {
      "USERNAME": "testuser",
      "PASSWORD": "testpass123"
    }
  }'
```

-   `GET /api/test-data/{id}`: Get test data by ID.
-   `GET /api/test-data`: Get all test data.
-   `PUT /api/test-data/{id}`: Update test data.
-   `DELETE /api/test-data/{id}`: Delete test data.

### 3. Flows & Flow Steps

**Enhanced Flow Creation**

The recommended way to create a flow is to use the enhanced flow creation API, which allows you to define the flow, its steps, and their test data in a single call.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/flows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "squashTestCaseId": 12345,
    "flowSteps": [
      {
        "applicationId": 1,
        "branch": "main",
        "testTag": "login-tests",
        "testStage": "test",
        "description": "Login functionality tests",
        "testData": [
          {
            "applicationId": 1,
            "category": "LOGIN_CREDENTIALS",
            "description": "Standard user credentials",
            "testData": {
              "USERNAME": "testuser",
              "PASSWORD": "testpass123"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "applicationId": 1,
        "branch": "main",
        "testTag": "dashboard-tests",
        "testStage": "test",
        "description": "Dashboard functionality tests",
        "testData": []
      }
    ]
  }'
```

-   `GET /api/flows/{id}`: Get a flow by ID.
-   `POST /api/flows/{id}/execute`: Execute a flow.
-   `GET /api/flow-executions/{id}`: Get details of a flow execution.

### 4. Real-time Log Streaming

To view live logs for a running flow execution, open the following URL in your browser. Replace `{flowExecutionUUID}` with the ID of your flow execution.

`http://localhost:8080/logs.html?flowExecutionUUID={flowExecutionUUID}`

This will open a terminal-like view in your browser that streams logs in real-time.
